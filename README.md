Middleware service for transferring welcome and deposit bonues

### Installation

This module is a part of middleware services. You can install it in 2 ways:

1) through core middleware installer  [middleware installer](https://github.com/ChronoBank/middleware)
2) by hands: just clone the repo, do 'npm install', set your .env - and you are ready to go

#### About
This module is used for transferring welcome and deposit bonuses (as chronobank's NEM's mosaics to user's address).


#### How does it work

There are 2 cases, when you can recieve some mosaic's minutes on your presonal count:
1) when you fill in profile
2) when you make a deposit

Under the hood, this module tracks events from  [sc-processor](https://github.com/ChronoBank/middleware-eth-chrono-sc-processor). In case, we meet setHash event (which stands for user fill profile's action) or deposit event - we just grab the address of user, and amount of deposit (in case it's deposit event) - and transfer him mosaics on his NEM's address

##### сonfigure your .env
